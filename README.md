## üìå Choosing the Right ML/DL Model
Selecting the appropriate machine learning (ML) or deep learning (DL) model depends on the type of problem, dataset characteristics, and computational resources available. Below is a general guide:

### üîç **Traditional Machine Learning Models**
#### üìä **Classification Problems** (e.g., Diabetes Prediction, Spam Detection)
- **Logistic Regression**: Simple, interpretable, works well with linear separable data.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Effective for small datasets with clear class separation.
- **Random Forest**: Handles non-linearity well, robust to overfitting.
- **Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)**: High accuracy but computationally expensive.

#### üî¢ **Regression Problems** (e.g., House Price Prediction, Stock Price Forecasting)
- **Linear Regression**: Simple and interpretable, assumes linear relationships.
- **Decision Trees & Random Forest**: Captures non-linearity, robust to outliers.
- **Gradient Boosting Regressors (XGBoost, LightGBM)**: Best for structured/tabular data.

#### üé≠ **Clustering Problems** (e.g., Customer Segmentation, Anomaly Detection)
- **K-Means**: Simple and fast, assumes spherical clusters.
- **DBSCAN**: Identifies clusters of varying density, robust to noise.
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Useful for visualization but computationally expensive.

### üß† **Deep Learning Models**
#### üñº **Computer Vision (Image Classification, Object Detection)**
- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)**: Best for image classification (e.g., ResNet, VGG, EfficientNet).
- **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**: Real-time object detection.
- **Faster R-CNN**: Accurate object detection, used in complex applications.

#### üîä **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
- **RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks)**: Suitable for sequential data.
- **LSTM/GRU**: Improved version of RNN for longer dependencies.
- **Transformer Models (BERT, GPT, T5)**: Best for text understanding, translation, summarization.

#### ‚è≥ **Time Series Forecasting**
- **LSTM**: Captures long-term dependencies in sequences.
- **ARIMA**: Good for small datasets, interpretable.
- **Facebook Prophet**: Easy-to-use forecasting model, robust to missing data.
